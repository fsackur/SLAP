# Toolkit

The camp toolkit must contain the following:

1. Stanley knives, x2
2. Craft knives, x2
3. Screwdriver selection (with x2 of the most commonly-used sizes)
4. Wirestrippers, x2 (at least one of these should be a high-quality tool)
5. Side-handled cutters, large
6. Crimping tool (this is required for the automotive connectors) (this may be incorporated into the wire strippers)
7. Heatshrink tubing, assorted
8. Electrical tape
9. Gaffa tape
10. Spare connectors
11. Spare cable, of various types
12. Automotive blade fuses
13. Terminal strips ("Chocolate block" connectors)
14. Lever nuts
15. Multimeter
16. Adjustable spanner or wrench, to work with car battery terminals

Nice to have:

17. Spade connectors
18. Spare car battery terminals
19. A hoe or trenching tool, for burying cable
20. Side-handled cutters, small

The reason for requiring 2 of the common tools is that there's often a lot of work at setup time, and two people can get it done faster.

It's assumed that the camp will have a drill/driver and boxes of screws; it's necessary to fix some electrical fittings into beams to keep them off the ground (for accessibility, and to avoid splashes from wet conditions).
