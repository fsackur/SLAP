# Toolkit

The camp toolkit must contain the following:

1. Stanley knives, x2
2. Craft knives, x2
3. Screwdriver selection (with x2 of the most commonly-used sizes)
4. Wirestrippers, x2
5. Crimping tool (this is required for the automotive connectors)
6. Heatshrink tubing, assorted
7. Electrical tape
8. Gaffa tape
9. Spare connectors
10. Spare cable, of various types
11. Automotive blade fuses
12. Terminal strips ("Chocolate block" connectors)
13. Lever nuts
14. A multimeter

Nice to have:

12. Spade connectors
13. Spare car battery terminals
14. A hoe or trenching tool, for burying cable

The reason for requiring 2 of the common tools is that there's often a lot of work at setup time, and two people can get it done faster.
